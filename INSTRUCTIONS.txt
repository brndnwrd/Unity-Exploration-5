BROADSIDE CHALLENGE by Brendan Ward

This is a basic pinball game based on the broadside mechanic
of the 1992 Black Rose pinball machine.

==All Objects======
===================
The game contains a moving ball, flippers to represent the player,
a static frame to contain everything (including a target at the top center
and two intangible lanes to show alignment), and the score display.

==Behavior=========
===================
The ball will roll around with gravity towards the bottom of the screen.
The frame will keep the ball inside. The flippers can hit the ball.
If the ball touches the grey target at the top center of the screen it will
be kicked back to its starting position at the top of the rail. Every time
the target is hit, a point is scored. If the ball falls below the flippers,
the game is over.

==Controls=========
===================
The left and right flippers are controlled by the left and right arrow keys
respictively. The game can be reset by pressing space.

==Scoring==========
===================
1 point is scored by hitting the target at the top of the lane.

==Game Over========
===================
The game is over if the ball falls below the flippers. It can be reset with space.
